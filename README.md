🚀 Unauthorized Weapon Detection Dashboard (FYP)

This repository contains the interface design and personalized learning path dashboard for a Final Year Project (FYP) focused on Unauthorized Weapon Detection using Deep Learning.

The dashboard is built as a single-page, responsive application to visualize project progress, track milestones (Data, Model, Training, Deployment), manage resources, and facilitate team collaboration and feedback.

🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard serves as the central hub for managing the deep learning development lifecycle of the weapon detection system. It provides immediate visibility into the status of core phases:

Module 1: Data Acquisition & Prep (Completed)

Module 2: Model Selection & Design (In Progress)

Module 3: Model Training & Tuning (Upcoming)

Module 4: Real-time Deployment (Upcoming)

✨ Features

Progress Tracking: Overall project percentage and individual module completion status.

Dynamic Navigation: Single-page application (SPA) switching between Dashboard, Team & Feedback, and Resources views.

Deep Learning Context: Content tailored to reflect key computer vision milestones (e.g., COCO format labeling, mAP targets, YOLO architectures).

Responsive Design: Optimized for viewing on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Technology Stack

This entire application is self-contained and implemented in a single file for maximum portability and quick deployment.

HTML5: Structure and content.

Tailwind CSS (via CDN): All modern, responsive styling and dark theme implementation.

JavaScript (Vanilla): Logic for view switching and navigation.

💻 Setup and Installation

Since this project is contained within a single index.html file, running it is extremely simple.
